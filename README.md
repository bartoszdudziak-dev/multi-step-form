# Multi Step Form

See the live version of [Multi Step Form](https://bartoszdudziak-dev.github.io/task-react-styling/).

A project created for educational purposes during an individual frontend mentoring session. I managed to use several new technologies that allowed me to better understand React library.

**Main features**:
- Reusable components designed with neumorphism
- Client-side validation
- Real-time error handling
- Smooth navigation between steps
- Stepper progress indicator
- Custom inputs and dropdown
