# Multi Step Form

See the live version of [Multi Step Form](https://bartoszdudziak-dev.github.io/multi-step-form/).

A project created for educational purposes during an individual frontend mentoring session. I managed to use several new technologies that allowed me to better understand React library.

**Main features**:
- 🔁 Reusable components designed with neumorphism
- 🛡️ Client-side validation
- 🚨 Real-time error handling
- 🚀 Smooth navigation between steps
- 📶 Stepper progress indicator
- 🎨 Custom inputs and dropdown

## 💭 Conclusions for future projects

I would like to improve:
- project folder organization
- usage of TypeScript especially custom checkbox and radio inputs
- theming with styled-components
